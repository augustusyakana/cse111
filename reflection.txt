Please respond thoroughly (at least two sentences for each question) to
the following three questions.

1. Describe an experience you had this semester where you saw the power of
functions.
- When we started working with dictionaries and lists! Everything is so much 
easier when you have functions. When you know you dont have to type multiple 
lines of code again and again because you can put them in functions and then just 
call that function.

2. In your judgment, what is the value of test functions?
- Test functions are a must! They provide the feedback that a syntax error, 
file error, or other errors would not. They will tell you when there is human error. 



3. Describe your process for troubleshooting and fixing a program that
has a problem. What is one thing you can do to improve your process?
- The first thing I do is check the error message to see what kind of 
error it is and identify where it went wrong. Next, I find the issue 
and start brainstorming any possible corrections. I need to figure 
out whether the problem is a file error, syntax error, or its something 
wrong with the way I typed it out. Once I've exhausted all options, I 
reach out to my mentors and even check on youtube or google.
